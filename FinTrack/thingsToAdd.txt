Ideas that I can Implement :-

Register a household so that you can see, the expense of your family members,
Create an evnolope of budget items with a particular constraint budget,
Create syncfusion calculator to calculate,
Give options to add Label tags, description, Payee name, Date time, payment type, status, Place of payment, reciept or attachments(give option to take photos of recipt from camera if possible),

Categories and or subcategories take from timely bills or wallet app,
Recent records overview, 
Chart for wallet balance trend with percentage, 
chart for just the expense structure,
option to add upcoming planned payments, with its dsdseparate timeline,
option to add more cards to track different things (MAYBE give a separate scrollview page for the same named "Charts"),
option ot add recurring debts like Loan interests, Leasing, Mortgage,
Give notification when predicted expense for a month is greater than the budget set,
maybe add storage for deleted and completed goals,
search funtionality searchs the records corressponding to the particular category in This Month (add SearchResults Page) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings:- set first day of the week, month , year; , Clear all data, export csv file of the records, see old records with the given interval, old budgets and goals that are completed, notes (write notes to yourself), maybe sometype of customizable display, select start screen, maybe some type of security pincode, 

Accounts:- Cash, Debit card , credit card etc.

may be convert the repository structure to the Igeneric repository of type T

inject apiService in frontend rather than creating a new instance of it everytime

His implementation :- API Controller(has service Injected)-> Service(has mapper and repository injected) -> Repository (applicationDbCOntext and DbSet)

My implementation :- APIServiceFrontend (has nothing injected just apiUrl) ->API Controller(has Repository Injected)-> Repository (applicationDbContext and mapper injected)

The problem is that I need to create an interface for apiservice in frontend to inject it, but first I need to figure out if my DTOs need to be the extension of base entity for using generic apiservice.

Also I need to figure out if there is a need to create a seperate DTO for every http method or not like employee create dto, employee update dto, etc.

if not then what changes should be made in the DTOs to make them usable.

also I need to figure out how to call the GetFilteredAsync method of the repository in the frontend.

do I need to create a base entity for the DTOs or not.

First see and understand his architecture then implement in your project in your own way.

Doubt : This is employeeCreate : 
public record EmployeeCreate(string FirstName, string LastName, int AddressId, int JobId);

Ans this is Employee model:
public class Employee : BaseEntity
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = default!;
    public string LastName { get; set; } = default!;
    public Address Address { get; set; } = default!;
    public Job Job { get; set; } = default!;
    public List<Team> Teams { get; set; } = default!;
}

And this is inside the DTOEntityMapper:
CreateMap<EmployeeCreate, Employee>()
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Id, opt => opt.Ignore())
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Teams, opt => opt.Ignore())
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Job, opt => opt.Ignore());

what happens to the JobId and AddressId which is sent in EmployeeCreateDTO?

        I'd be glad to assist you with retrieving the token in your MAUI Blazor Hybrid project's AuthStateProvider file. However, due to security concerns, it's not recommended to directly store the JWT token in local storage within a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid application. This is because hybrid apps can potentially access the local storage of the underlying native platform (Android/iOS), which might not offer the same level of security as browser-based local storage.

Here's a more secure approach for your MAUI Blazor Hybrid project:

1. Utilize Secure Enclave (Android) or Keychain (iOS):

These platform-specific secure storage mechanisms offer a more robust way to store sensitive data like JWT tokens on mobile devices. Here's a general outline:

Android: Leverage the Android KeyStore System (KeyStore) or AndroidX EncryptedSharedPreferences to securely store the token. You'll need to interact with these APIs using platform-specific code (e.g., Kotlin/Java for Android).
iOS: Utilize the iOS Keychain API to securely store the token. You can use C# bindings or platform-specific code (Swift/Objective-C) to interact with the Keychain.
2. Retrieve Token During Login:

When your application successfully logs in and receives the SignInResponseDTO from the API, extract the token from the Token property within the UserDTO.
Don't store the token directly! Instead, use the platform-specific secure storage mechanism to store the token (e.g., KeyStore on Android, Keychain on iOS).
3. Modify AuthStateProvider to Read from Secure Storage:

Create methods in your AuthStateProvider to interact with the secure storage on each platform (Android/iOS).
In the GetAuthenticationStateAsync method, attempt to retrieve the token from secure storage.
If the token is found and valid (e.g., not expired), create a ClaimsPrincipal object from the token using JwtParser.ParseClaimsFromJwt.
Return an AuthenticationState with the ClaimsPrincipal.
If the token retrieval fails or is invalid, return an AuthenticationState with an empty ClaimsPrincipal.
4. Handle Token Updates:

When your application needs to refresh the token (e.g., due to expiration), follow a similar approach:
Call the API to obtain a new token.
Store the new token securely using the platform-specific storage mechanism.
Notify the AuthStateProvider about the updated token (if necessary).
Key Points:

This approach prioritizes security by avoiding local storage for the token in a hybrid app environment.
You'll need platform-specific code (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS) to interact with the secure storage APIs.
Consider using libraries or frameworks that might simplify secure storage access in .NET MAUI.
Additional Considerations:

If your project doesn't require offline functionality, you could maintain the token in memory (e.g., using a static variable in a service) and refresh it as needed. This approach can be simpler but depends on your specific use case.
Always handle potential errors (e.g., secure storage access failures, invalid tokens) gracefully in your code.
By implementing these steps, you can securely manage JWT tokens in your MAUI Blazor Hybrid project while maintaining a good user experience.

the problem is that the navigation component is not able to resolve the dependencies of the viewmodel that is being navigated to, so the viewmodel is not able to get the data from the api service, so the viewmodel is not able to show the data on the page.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.	Use a Dependency Injection (DI) Container: DI containers like Autofac, Unity, or Prism can help manage the dependencies of your viewmodels. You can register your services and their dependencies in the DI container and let it handle the resolution of dependencies when creating instances of the viewmodels. This way, when the navigation component creates a new instance of the viewmodel, it will automatically resolve the required dependencies.
2.	Service Locator Pattern: If you're not using a DI container, you can implement the Service Locator pattern. Create a static class that acts as a central registry for your services. In this class, you can register your services and their dependencies. Then, in your viewmodel, you can use the service locator to resolve the required dependencies when needed.
3.	Navigation Wrapper: Another approach is to create a navigation wrapper that handles the navigation logic and dependency resolution. This wrapper can be responsible for creating instances of the viewmodels and resolving their dependencies before navigating to the desired page. By encapsulating the navigation and dependency resolution logic in a separate class, you can ensure that the dependencies are properly resolved before the viewmodel is used.
4.	Create a New Instance of the HTTP Client: If the issue is specifically related to the HTTP client not being able to resolve its dependencies, you can try creating a new instance of the HTTP client within the content view. This way, the HTTP client will have access to the required dependencies when making API calls.
