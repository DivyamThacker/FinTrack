Do something about title of the page still showing,
take toast code from tangy blazor
think about page for liablities and assets

Remember to correct the logic of Budgets start time end time and period in budget repository and api controller to check if the request is valid or not, also correct the model of budget to have key and foreign key for spentAmount.
Add default values in Dbinitializer
try page instead of component for blazor calculator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Things to Remember:-
add account or user id to everything (every model), 
add migration every time model is changed (default project : DataAccess, startup project : FinTrack API),
SQL Query : Select * from FinTrackDB.dbo.Budgets;
UPDATE FinTrackDB.dbo.Transactions
SET UserId = REPLACE(UserId, '0', '7f7d1487-94d2-40ee-b282-d3085edd948f')
WHERE UserId = '0';

Select * from FinTrackDB.dbo.AspNetUsers for json auto; (way to get json output from the ms sql server)

Ideas that I can Implement :-

Register a household so that you can see, the expense of your family members,
Create an evnolope of budget items with a particular constraint budget,
Create syncfusion calculator to calculate,
Give options to add Label tags, description, Payee name, Date time, payment type, status, Place of payment, reciept or attachments(give option to take photos of recipt from camera if possible),

Categories and or subcategories take from timely bills or wallet app,
Recent records overview, 
Chart for wallet balance trend with percentage, 
chart for just the expense structure,
option to add upcoming planned payments, with its dsdseparate timeline,
option to add more cards to track different things (MAYBE give a separate scrollview page for the same named "Charts"),
option ot add recurring debts like Loan interests, Leasing, Mortgage,
Give notification when predicted expense for a month is greater than the budget set,
maybe add storage for deleted and completed goals,
search funtionality searchs the records corressponding to the particular category in This Month (add SearchResults Page) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings:- set first day of the week, month , year; , Clear all data, export csv file of the records, see old records with the given interval, old budgets and goals that are completed, notes (write notes to yourself), maybe sometype of customizable display, select start screen, maybe some type of security pincode, 

Accounts:- Cash, Debit card , credit card etc.

may be convert the repository structure to the Igeneric repository of type T

inject apiService in frontend rather than creating a new instance of it everytime

His implementation :- API Controller(has service Injected)-> Service(has mapper and repository injected) -> Repository (applicationDbCOntext and DbSet)

My implementation :- APIServiceFrontend (has nothing injected just apiUrl) ->API Controller(has Repository Injected)-> Repository (applicationDbContext and mapper injected)

The problem is that I need to create an interface for apiservice in frontend to inject it, but first I need to figure out if my DTOs need to be the extension of base entity for using generic apiservice.

Also I need to figure out if there is a need to create a seperate DTO for every http method or not like employee create dto, employee update dto, etc.

if not then what changes should be made in the DTOs to make them usable.

also I need to figure out how to call the GetFilteredAsync method of the repository in the frontend.

do I need to create a base entity for the DTOs or not.

First see and understand his architecture then implement in your project in your own way.

Doubt : This is employeeCreate : 
public record EmployeeCreate(string FirstName, string LastName, int AddressId, int JobId);

Ans this is Employee model:
public class Employee : BaseEntity
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = default!;
    public string LastName { get; set; } = default!;
    public Address Address { get; set; } = default!;
    public Job Job { get; set; } = default!;
    public List<Team> Teams { get; set; } = default!;
}

And this is inside the DTOEntityMapper:
CreateMap<EmployeeCreate, Employee>()
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Id, opt => opt.Ignore())
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Teams, opt => opt.Ignore())
	.ForMember(dest => dest.Job, opt => opt.Ignore());

what happens to the JobId and AddressId which is sent in EmployeeCreateDTO?

var json = Preferences.Default.Get("user", ""); // get the JSON string from preferences

  If I add account balance in accounts model, then I would need to send the state has changed attribute to a common shared model like acocunts

(for understanding purpose (for your information) FYI )    
IN my project positive records are deposits and negative records are withdrawals from the account.

Remove user id from everywhere after adding account ids

 var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User.Identity);
    var account = await _context.Accounts.FindAsync(user.AccountId);

    public async Task<decimal> GetCurrentBalance()
{
    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User.Identity);
    var account = await _context.Accounts.FindAsync(user.AccountId);

    return account?.Balance ?? 0; // Return 0 if account not found
}
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

maybe when recent budget or goal is not available , do conditional rendering of the component and give a plus sign to add budget whiech redirects to budget page and also opens sets the isCreating flag to true so that it shows the create form.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pages to be included: Portfolio , watchlist , find stocks, Trades

Maybe add account Id also in the code even when you want to get a single Goal according to a given goalId, ie. in Get(goalId)  api  call., similarly for other things alos
