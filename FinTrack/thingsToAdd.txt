Do something about title of the page still showing,
Change shortcuts ctrl k + ctrl C, ctrl k + ctrl U
Learn how to change dynamic resources colors by clicking the change theme button
maybe add total button next to last month and last week
take toast code from tangy blazor
think about page for liablities and assets
otp system to login via email or phone
view timely bills for more idea
Try to fix (back navigation arrow not working properly) (Try to solve it using navigation stack); 
What to do if I want to create Blazor Server app as my dummy project but it is only avialable as .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0 framework, while my other project in the same solution is only compatible with .NET 8.0 framework
add migration before performing check on budget repo
ReBuild app first, then carry forward with migration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Things to Remember:-
add account id to everything, 
add migration every time model is changed,

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Ideas that I can Implement :-

Register a household so that you can see, the expense of your family members,
Create an evnolope of budget items with a particular constraint budget,
Create syncfusion calculator to calculate,
Give options to add Label tags, description, Payee name, Date time, payment type, status, Place of payment, reciept or attachments(give option to take photos of recipt from camera if possible),

Categories and or subcategories take from timely bills or wallet app,
Recent records overview, 
Chart for wallet balance trend with percentage, 
chart for just the expense structure,
option to add upcoming planned payments, with its separate timeline,
option to add more cards to track different things (MAYBE give a separate scrollview page for the same named "Charts"),
option ot add recurring debts like Loan interests, Leasing, Mortgage,
Give notification when predicted expense for a month is greater than the budget set,
maybe add storage for deleted and completed goals,
search funtionality searchs the records corressponding to the particular category in last month (add SearchResults Page) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Model variables:-

3 types of payments :- income, expense transfer.
status :- Cleared, UnCleared, Reconciled (last priority)
Currency, Accounts, 

Goals:- name of thing you are saving for, category, target amount , saved already, desired date(allow nullable), note for motivating yourself, status (goal reached or not or paused, (settable)), last added week amount , estimated time to reach the goal, percentage already saved amount, checkbox option to give notification when goal is not expected to hit or the date is comming closer to complete the goal etcetra, Goal color and or icons(maybe add this to represent in charts), date time when goal was added

Budgets:- name, period(week, month, year, onetime(specify start and end date)), date time when budget was added, category , amount to spend (dont allow 0), total spent amount in that category (also allow all categories together) ,
daily average spent , daily average recommended expense to not overspend, expected date when budget money will end, status (pending, Busted/exceeded(overspent but time period not over) , underspent, overspent (time period over));

Transactions:- 


Settings:- set first day of the week, month , year; , Clear all data, export csv file of the records, see old records with the given interval, old budgets and goals that are completed, notes (write notes to yourself), maybe sometype of customizable display, select start screen, maybe some type of security pincode, 

Accounts:- Cash, Debit card , credit card etc.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Significance of variables:-

if period = year, then it takes starting date as 1st jan of the year of when the budget or goal is created.
